Steps
create a react app with the help of npx create-react-app <my app>
update the boiler plate and remove unwanted files

to install routing you need to install react-router-dom package 
    yarn add react-router-dom
        or
    npm i react-router-dom

create a root component lets make App component a root component

create a new folder name it component 

add another folder inside a component name pages

lets create 3 component inside pages folder 

home
about
contact

so now all your pages are assigned 

lets start learning how to use routing in SPA {Single Page Application}

you need to declare routes at root component for it to accessible 

lets import BrowserRouter, Routes and Route from react router dom

set all 3 pages to different routes

path / set to home
path /about set to about
path /contact set to contact

So far we only created routes now user won't be able to see any routes and don't know any information about which routes to select so in order to fix that issue we will create a NavBar
component and declare all the routes so its easy for user to select what page he wants to see.

lets create a NavBar Component
inside NavBar component we create a unordered list and set all our routes with a tag{anchor}
and set its attributes href with all the routes.
